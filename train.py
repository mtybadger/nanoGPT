The proposed solution looks good. It adds the necessary code to enable distributed training using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel and DistributedSampler. The init_distributed function initializes the process group using the specified backend and world size. The DataLoader is updated to use DistributedSampler, which ensures that each process only sees a subset of the data. The code also sets the device to the local rank and initializes the model with DDP if running in a distributed environment.
